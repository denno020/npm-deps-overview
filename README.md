# NPM Dependency Overview

Very simple application that will parse your `package.json`, extract dependencies, and then generate a basic overview
of those dependencies.

You can then user fuzzy search to look for a specific dependency, or keywords that you might expect to be in a description, which
might help you to find a specific dependency
